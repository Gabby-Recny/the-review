### ABSTRACT
The Review is a React application that utilizes the New York Times Top Stories API to generate the latest stories. The application is fully responsive for the user to easily access up-to-date stories from their desktop to mobile device. The user is enables to search stories by category or title to see the articles most relavant to their needs. Once the user selects an article, they are able to see a brief abstract and visit the New York Times website for the entire story. 

The Review is a [take-home challenge](https://mod4.turing.edu/projects/take_home/take_home_fe) provided by the Turing School of Software & Design to showcase my fundamental knowledge of React. The project took approximately eight hours to complete including styling and testing.
